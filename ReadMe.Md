Random Movement Agent-Based Model Simulation
Project Overview

This project is a Random Movement Agent-Based Model (ABM) Simulation implemented in Python. It simulates multiple autonomous agents moving randomly within a defined environment, demonstrating how complex system behavior can emerge from simple individual actions.

Objectives

Understand the fundamentals of agent-based modeling

Simulate random movement behavior of agents

Visualize agent interactions with the environment over time

Model Description

Agents: Independent entities that move randomly

Environment: 2D grid or continuous space

Movement Rule: Each agent selects a random direction at each time step

Constraints: Agents remain within simulation boundaries

Technologies Used

Python 3

Libraries: random, matplotlib, numpy (optional)

Output & Visualization

The simulation displays agents moving randomly over time. Output may include real-time animation, scatter plots of agent positions, or saved images showing movement patterns.

Possible Extensions

Add agent interactions (collision avoidance, attraction, repulsion)

Introduce obstacles in the environment

Assign different movement speeds to agents

Implement goal-oriented or rule-based movement

Export simulation data for analysis

Applications

Teaching and learning agent-based modeling

Studying emergent behavior

Simulation of biological or social systems
